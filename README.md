E- Commerce based warranty system using nfts.
The objective is to replace the physical warranty and have block chain based warranty using NFT which will ensure
authenticity and security.

Created a user-friendly e-commerce front-end which gives the seller ability to mint the warranty card details for the 
purchased item as an decaying NFT to blockchain of which the tokenId will be mapped to buyer address and Buyer can render 
the NFT on to its warranty card section. 
Linking the brand/ companiesâ€™ warranty programme to the NFT, allowing them to push repair/replacement details to the warranty card 
for owner to keep track of it. Nfts can be transferred making the reselling of product possible and using them as a medium to check ownership.
we use it for authenticity of the product because seller contract address and serial number details are pushed onto the warranty card
enabling to claim authenticity.
